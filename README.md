# Flappy-Bird
* Flappy Bird is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the bird Faby, which moves persistently to the right.
* It is a Java Application made using the Swing Package of Java. 
* There are three basic rules that drive Flappy Bird: <br>
A) Your bird gains downward speed as it falls, but will always flap up by the same height–just enough to stay between the two pipes. <br>
B) Your bird’s horizontal speed remains constant. <br>
C) The pipes through which your bird flies appear at varying heights, but always have the same vertical clearance and horizontal distance between them.<br>
